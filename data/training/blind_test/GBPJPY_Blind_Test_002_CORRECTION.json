        "missed_clue": "High Resistance Liquidity Run. The lows were making Higher Lows (compression) rather than equal lows. Price was holding ABOVE the previous Bullish Order Block.",
        "concept_correction": "Support Validation vs. Resistance. Price consolidating ABOVE a bullish PD array is acceptance of higher prices, not exhaustion. Do not bet on reversals without a clear Market Structure Shift.",
