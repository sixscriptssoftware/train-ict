        "reasoning": "Price rallied aggressively to sweep the clean Equal Highs (BSL) from Jan 13 (~1.3480). It pierced them (to ~1.3490) and immediately rejected with sharp displacement down. This signature (Run on Liquidity -> Rejection) suggests the objective of the move is complete. The algorithm typically reverses after a BSL sweep to seek Discount prices or Sellside Liquidity."
