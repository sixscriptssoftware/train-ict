    "id": "GBPUSD_Blind_Test_001_CORRECTION",
    "chart_context": "GBPUSD 1H - Jan 14-16 timeframe",
    "vex_prediction": "Bullish (Targeting 1.3480 BSL)",
    "actual_outcome": "Bearish Breakdown (Targeting 1.3380 SSL)",
    "error_analysis": {
        "primary_error": "Misinterpreted distribution as bullish retracement",
        "missed_clue": "Failure Swing (Lower High) formed just before the drop. Market failed to displace above short-term structure.",
        "concept_correction": "Inducement vs. Target. The equal highs at 1.3480 were engineered as inducement to trap longs. The slow bleed down was not a flag, but a slide into a heavy sell program.",
        "future_rule": "IF price drifts down but FAILS to displace above the previous short-term high (Failure Swing), assume Bearish continuation, NOT bullish retracement."
