        "reasoning": "Price has rallied aggressively and is now consolidating in Premium without a clear displacement higher. Unlike a bullish flag which usually drifts down into Discount, this is hovering sideways. This often signifies 'Distribution' or engineering liquidity below (Swing Lows) to be swept. I expect a breakdown to clear the Sellside Liquidity below this range before any true continuation can happen."
