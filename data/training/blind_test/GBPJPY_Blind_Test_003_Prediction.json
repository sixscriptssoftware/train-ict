        "reasoning": "We see a clear Low formed around Jan 8th. Price then rallied aggressively above the central consolidation midpoint (Market Structure Shift Bullish). It has now retraced down into what looks like a Discount Order Block / Breaker region. The structure is making Higher Highs and Higher Lows from the bottom. I am applying the lesson from Test 002: Momentum is UP, structure is shifting UP, so I will bet on CONTINUATION to the highs, not a reversal."
