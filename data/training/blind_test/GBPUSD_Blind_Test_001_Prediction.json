        "reasoning": "Price has completed a corrective retracement leg (down) following a strong impulsive move (up). The consolidation prior to the blackout suggests accumulation in a Discount zone. The 'clean' highs above at 1.3470-80 act as a magnet (Draw on Liquidity). I expect immediate expansion UP into that blacked-out area."
