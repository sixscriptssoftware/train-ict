## 🏆 TEMPLATE TRADE: January 16, 2026 - EURUSD/GBPUSD

> **"When we agree on a setup together - you, me, and VEX - and we actually look at the charts, plot them properly, and talk about it... we are UNSTOPPABLE."**

### The Perfect Setup Formula:
1. **Prior displacement** establishes directional bias
2. **4H FVG** as primary entry zone
3. **15M OB + 15M FVG** confluence as secondary zone
4. **CBDR setup** present
5. **Asian range liquidity sweep** (highs for short, lows for long)
6. **Clear liquidity target** (opposite range low/high)
7. **Stop** above/below last opposing candle before displacement
8. **TP** at CBDR extension from opposite range

**Result: +$691 | FTMO CHALLENGE PASSED ✅**

## By Category

### Entry Timing
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ TEMPLATE: Enter at 4H FVG, but place stop to account for potential 15M OB+FVG retest. Trust the structure.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Three entries on same thesis = wait for better confirmation. If you've been stopped twice, the market is telling you something.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Right thesis, wrong execution. GU eventually hit target but over-trading cost -$234.

### Exit Timing
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ TEMPLATE: CBDR extension from opposite range = perfect TP zone. Hit full target +30.6 pips.
- **[2026-01-16 GBPUSD]** Know when to take profit - goal achieved (FTMO passed), no need to hold for more risk.
- **[2026-01-15 EURUSD]** Trust the HTF thesis and let winners run. Held through chop for +27 pips.

### Risk Management
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ TEMPLATE: Smart stop placement - above last up candle before down move, accounts for potential higher TF retest.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Account for spread on tight stops - a 1.5 pip stop can get hit by spread alone, even if price never touches your level.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Better to preserve capital than prove your thesis right. Living to trade another day beats being right and blown out.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** 6 trades on one pair in one session = over-trading. One good entry > multiple scratches.

### Psychology
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ TEMPLATE: When thesis is rock solid (multi-TF alignment), TRUST IT. Go to sleep. Don't micromanage.
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ Heavy price action? Stay confident when structure is intact. More confident than ever = A+ result.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Recognize when you're chasing/forcing a trade and step aside. Three attempts without new confirmation = forcing.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Not being in a trade is a valid position. FLAT is okay when conditions are choppy.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Counter-trend trading when your thesis is intact = emotional trading. The BUY attempt lost $53.

### ICT Concepts
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ TEMPLATE: 4H FVG + 15M OB + 15M FVG + CBDR + Asian sweep = KILLER confluence
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ Displacement from prior day sets the tone. Follow-through trades can be even better than initial entry.
- **[2026-01-16 EURUSD]** ⭐ Two FVGs on different timeframes = price CAN retest deeper one. Plan for it, don't panic.
- **[2026-01-15 GBPUSD]** Flash wicks / Judas swings can stop you out even when thesis is correct. Need wider stops or better timing on re-entries.
- **[2026-01-15 EURUSD]** Weekly Sell Model delivered. Tuesday high held, price ran to -0.5 extension. Model works when you trust it.

## Jan 15 Deep Dive: PSYCHOLOGY BREAKDOWN

### The Numbers That Hurt

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| GU: 1 entry at 1.34285, 20 pip stop, TP at 1.3385 | **+46 pips = ~$345 profit** |
| GU: What actually happened (8 entries) | **-28 pips = -$234 loss** |
| **Difference** | **$579** |

Same day. Same pair. Same thesis. **$579 difference.**

### Psychology Triggers Identified

1. **FOMO** - "I don't want to miss this move"
   - Reality: You can't catch every move. Better to miss 10 pips of entry than get stopped 3 times.

2. **Ego/Proving Right** - "I KNOW this is going down"
   - Reality: Being right doesn't matter if you can't capitalize. The market rewards discipline, not ego.

3. **Revenge Re-entry** - "I'll just get back in, it's going my way"
   - Reality: Each re-entry without NEW confirmation is gambling, not trading.

4. **Desperation** - Trade #5 was a BUY when thesis was SHORT
   - Reality: Counter-trend trades when you're frustrated = emotional trading.

5. **Tight Stop Syndrome** - 1.5-4.5 pip stops getting eaten
   - Reality: GU has 3-5 pip spread. A 2 pip stop is basically free money for market makers.

### The TWO STRIKE RULE (New)

**If you get stopped twice on the same thesis/pair/session:**
1. STOP TRADING THAT PAIR
2. Wait for next session (London → NY, or NY → next day London)
3. Require NEW confirmation before re-entry
4. No exceptions. This is non-negotiable.

### What EU Did Different

| Factor | EURUSD | GBPUSD |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Entries | 1 | 8 |
| Stop Width | 20 pips | 1.5-4.5 pips |
| Patience | High | None |
| Emotion | Calm | FOMO/Revenge |
| Outcome | +$534 | -$234 |

**Lesson: The PAIR didn't matter. The EXECUTION did.**
