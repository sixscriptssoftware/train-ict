**Focus Pairs:** EURUSD, GBPUSD

---

## 🇪🇺🇺🇸 EURUSD Analysis
**Current Price:** 1.15988
**Trend:** Daily Bullish / H4 Bearish (Retracement Phase)

**The Narrative:**
We are in a **Daily Bullish Trend**, but the **4H Internal Structure is Bearish**, indicating we are currently in a complex pullback phase. We are looking for the H4 bearish structure to fail (MSS) so we can resume the daily trend targeting the unmitigated highs.

**Action Plan:**
Price is currently sitting directly above a **H4 Bullish FVG (1.15957)**. Watch this zone closely at market open/London session for an accumulation setup.

**Key Levels:**
*   🔴 **BSL (Buy-Side Liquidity):** `1.16319` (Daily High) - *Primary Target*
*   🔴 **Premium Array (Resist):** `1.16353 - 1.16275` (Daily Bearish FVG)
*   🟢 **H4 Bullish FVG (Support):** `1.15957 - 1.15787` (Immediate Support)
*   🟢 **Discount Array (Deep Support):** `1.15496 - 1.14608` (Daily Bullish FVG)
*   🟢 **SSL (Sell-Side Liquidity):** `1.15770` (Protected Low)

## 🇬🇧🇺🇸 GBPUSD Analysis
**Current Price:** 1.33796
**Trend:** Daily Bullish / H4 Bearish (Deep Retracement)

**The Narrative:**
Similar to EU, `GBPUSD` is **Daily Bullish** but retracing on the **4H**. However, GU appears to have more room to drop compared to EU. It is currently "hanging" in void space with the nearest high-quality discount array about ~50 pips lower.

**Action Plan:**
Patience required. Do not long yet. Wait for price to dip into the `1.33220` region before looking for reversal signatures (Turtle Soup or MSS).

**Key Levels:**
*   🔴 **BSL (Buy-Side Liquidity):** `1.34016` (Daily High)
*   🔴 **Premium Array (Resist):** `1.34198 - 1.34132` (Daily Bearish FVG)
*   🟢 **Discount Array (Support):** `1.33221 - 1.32218` (Daily Bullish FVG) - *Optimal Entry Zone*
*   🟢 **H4 Bullish FVG:** `1.32922 - 1.32850` (Confluent with Daily Discount)

## 🧠 SMT Correlation Watch
**EURUSD** is nearing its support (1.1595) *faster* than **GBPUSD** is nearing its support (1.3322).
*   **Watch for SMT:** If EURUSD sweeps a local low and reverses aggressively while GBPUSD fails to make a lower low (or vice versa), that is our trigger.
*   Given EU is closer to support, it may lead the reversal leg.

**Invalidation:**
*   EURUSD Close < `1.15496`
*   GBPUSD Close < `1.32218`
