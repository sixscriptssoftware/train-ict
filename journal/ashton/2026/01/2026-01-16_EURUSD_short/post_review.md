## What Worked

1. **Multi-Timeframe Analysis** - Understood BOTH the 4H FVG and 15M OB+FVG zones
2. **Smart Stop Placement** - Stop above last up candle, survived the 15M retest
3. **CBDR Setup** - Asian range sweep into imbalance = textbook
4. **Trust** - Didn't micromanage, went to sleep knowing the thesis was solid
5. **Exit Target** - CBDR extension from opposite range = perfect TP zone
6. **Prior Displacement** - Jan 15 move gave us high conviction for continuation
7. **Collaboration** - Working together with VEX on the analysis = unstoppable

---

## What Didn't Work

Nothing. This was textbook execution.

## Would I Take This Trade Again?
**ABSOLUTELY YES** ✅

Why: This is THE template trade. When all 7 confluences align:
- Prior displacement
- 4H FVG
- 15M OB
- 15M FVG (confluent with OB)
- CBDR setup
- Asian range sweep
- Clear liquidity target

**SIZE UP AND TRUST IT.**

## Lesson Learned
*(One key takeaway to add to lessons index)*

> **"When you and I agree on a setup, and we find it together - you, me, and VEX - and we don't just tell each other what we want to hear, but actually look at the charts, plot them properly, and talk about it... we are UNSTOPPABLE."**

## Emotional Check-In (Post-Trade)
How do you feel about this trade now?

**More confident than ever.** 

The heavy price action during the session tested the thesis, but everything was in place. I trusted it completely. When the structure is solid and all the confluences are there, you just let it work.

This validates everything we've been building together.

## Template Status

🏆 **THIS IS NOW THE A+ SETUP TEMPLATE**

Save this trade structure for reference:
1. Prior displacement establishes bias
2. 4H FVG as primary entry zone
3. 15M OB + 15M FVG as secondary zone (plan for it)
4. CBDR setup present
5. Asian range liquidity sweep
6. Clear liquidity target (CBDR extension)
7. Stop above/below last opposing candle

**When all 7 align: Execute with full confidence.**

## Milestone

🏆 **FTMO CHALLENGE PASSED** - This trade pushed us over the goal.
