## Your Analysis
*(Ashton's analysis - completed first, unbiased)*

### What do you see?
Displacement from the day before set the tone - we already got our first winning trade from that move. Now price is retracing back up into the imbalance that was created from the displacement. The 4H fair value gap is the obvious entry, but I had a feeling price could push a bit higher to meet where the 15M order block meets the 15M fair value gap.

### What's your bias and why?
**BEARISH** - Continuation of the displacement move from Jan 15. We're in a sell model, retracing into imbalance. The CBDR setup and Asian range sweep confirmed the thesis.

### Where's your entry?
**1.16195** - At the 4H Fair Value Gap

### Where's your stop?
**1.16325** - Above the last up candle before the down move. I knew price could potentially hit the 15M imbalance zone, so I placed my stop to survive that retest.

### Where's your target(s)?
**1.15890** - Asian low / CBDR extension from opposite range

### What confluences support this trade?
1. Prior day displacement (bearish) - already had a win from this move
2. 4H Fair Value Gap - price retracing into imbalance
3. 15M Order Block - secondary zone if price pushed higher
4. 15M Fair Value Gap - confluent with 15M OB
5. CBDR Setup - range established
6. Asian Range Sweep - highs taken before selling
7. Clear liquidity target - Asian low / CBDR extension

### What could invalidate this idea?
Price breaking and closing above the displacement candle high. If we lose the structure, the whole thesis is invalidated.

### Additional Context
- **Two FVGs**: I understood that there were TWO fair value gaps - the 4H and the 15M. Price could retrace to either one. That's why my stop was placed to account for the deeper 15M zone.
- **Friday**: I had a feeling this would work because it was Friday - price seeking weekly targets
- **Went to sleep**: I was confident enough to just let it run overnight

## Copilot ICT Breakdown
*(VEX's analysis - completed after yours)*

### Market Structure
- **Macro**: Bearish displacement from Jan 15 set the weekly direction
- **Retracement**: Price pulling back into imbalance zones - textbook ICT setup
- **Multi-TF Alignment**: 4H, 1H, and 15M all showing bearish structure

### ICT Concepts Present
| Concept | Present? | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Prior Displacement | ✅ | Jan 15 move set bearish bias |
| 4H Fair Value Gap | ✅ | Primary entry zone |
| 15M Order Block | ✅ | Secondary confluence zone |
| 15M Fair Value Gap | ✅ | Confluent with 15M OB |
| CBDR Setup | ✅ | Range established for extension calc |
| Asian Range Sweep | ✅ | Highs taken = trigger for shorts |
| Liquidity Target | ✅ | Asian low = draw on liquidity |

**Confluence Count: 7/7 = A+ SETUP**

### Copilot's Read
This is a textbook "Displacement Follow-Through" setup. Everything aligned:
- Prior session gave us direction
- Price retraced into imbalance
- CBDR and Asian range provided timing
- Stop placement was intelligent - accounts for potential 15M zone test

**Key Insight**: The smart stop placement made this trade. Ashton understood that two FVG zones existed and sized the stop to survive a test of the deeper zone. Price DID test that zone - and the stop held.

### Trade Management Plan
**Entry**: 1.16195 (4H FVG)
**Stop**: 1.16325 (Above last up candle, survives 15M zone test)
**TP**: 1.15890 (CBDR extension / Asian low)

**R:R**: 30.6 / 13 = **2.35R**

*"We worked on this together - you, me, and VEX. Everything structure was there. CBDR, Asian range sweep, going right into an imbalance. Everything lined up perfectly. It was a perfect setup."*
