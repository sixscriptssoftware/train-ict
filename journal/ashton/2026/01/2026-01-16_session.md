## Trade 1: EURUSD SHORT (MAIN TRADE) ⭐

### Setup
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Pair | EURUSD |
| Direction | SHORT |
| Lots | 2.0 (main), 1.0 (scalps) |
| Entry | 1.16195 |
| Stop Loss | 1.16325 |
| Take Profit | 1.15890 |
| Result | **+$612.75** (+30.6 pips) ✅ TP HIT |

### Thesis
**Multi-timeframe confluence entry:**
1. **Displacement from prior day** - Already had a winning short from the previous session
2. **4H Fair Value Gap** - Initial entry level where price retraced into imbalance
3. **15M Order Block + 15M FVG** - Knew price could push higher to meet this confluence zone
4. **Stop Placement** - Above the last up candle before the down move (smart placement accounting for potential 15M retest)
5. **Target** - Asian session low (liquidity)

### ICT Concepts Used
- ✅ Displacement (from prior day)
- ✅ 4H Fair Value Gap
- ✅ 15M Order Block
- ✅ 15M Fair Value Gap (confluence with OB)
- ✅ CBDR Setup
- ✅ Asian Range Sweep (highs taken)
- ✅ Liquidity Target (Asian low)
- ✅ Multi-timeframe alignment

### Execution Notes
- Entered at 4H imbalance
- Stop placed intelligently above last bullish candle (anticipating potential 15M retest)
- Price DID push into 15M OB+FVG zone - stop held perfectly
- Went to sleep, woke up in profit
- **Trusted the setup completely**

### What Worked
1. **Multi-timeframe analysis** - 4H FVG as entry, 15M OB+FVG as "worst case" zone
2. **Smart stop placement** - Accounted for volatility, gave trade room to breathe
3. **CBDR/Asian range** - Textbook sweep of highs into sell zone
4. **Structure alignment** - Everything pointed SHORT
5. **Trust** - Didn't panic during volatility, held conviction

## Trade 2: GBPUSD SHORT

### Setup
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Pair | GBPUSD |
| Direction | SHORT |
| Lots | 0.5 |
| Entry | 1.34038 |
| Stop Loss | 1.34200 |
| Take Profit | 1.33600 |
| Result | **+$113.00** (+22.6 pips) ✅ Manual close |

### Thesis
- Same framework as EURUSD
- CBDR play with Asian range sweep
- Hitting imbalance zone
- Exit lined up with **CBDR extension** from opposite range

### Exit Decision
Manually closed because:
- Goal achieved (FTMO challenge passed)
- No need to hold for more risk
- Perfect execution, took the win

## 🎓 KEY LESSON

> **"When you and I agree on a setup, and we find it together - you, me, and VEX - and we don't just tell each other what we want to hear, but actually look at the charts, plot them properly, and talk about it... we are UNSTOPPABLE."**

## Template Elements (FOR VEX LEARNING)

5. ✅ Asian range liquidity sweep (highs for short, lows for long)
