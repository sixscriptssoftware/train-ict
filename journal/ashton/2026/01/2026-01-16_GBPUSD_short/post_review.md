## What Worked

1. **Correlated Thesis** - Same framework as EURUSD worked on GBP
2. **CBDR Play** - Asian range sweep into imbalance
3. **Patience** - Held through the volatility
4. **Exit Management** - Closed manually when goal achieved
5. **No Greed** - Took the profit, didn't push for more

---

## What Didn't Work

Nothing major. Could have let it run to full TP, but goal was achieved.

---

## Would I Take This Trade Again?
**YES** ✅

Why: When EURUSD gives an A+ setup, checking correlated pairs for the same thesis = smart money management. Same framework, same results.

## Lesson Learned
*(One key takeaway to add to lessons index)*

> **"When FTMO challenge is passed, there's no need to hold for more risk. Take the win. Goal achieved."**

## Mistake Category (if applicable)
- [ ] Early entry
- [ ] Late entry
- [ ] Ignored HTF bias
- [ ] Wrong session/killzone
- [ ] FOMO
- [ ] Revenge trade
- [ ] Oversized position
- [ ] Moved stop loss
- [x] Exited before TP (but for good reason)
- [ ] Held too long
- [ ] No clear invalidation

**Note**: Exiting early wasn't a mistake - it was smart risk management. FTMO was passed, no need to push.

---

## Emotional Check-In (Post-Trade)
How do you feel about this trade now?

**Validated.** Same thesis as EURUSD, same positive result. When the framework works, it works across correlated pairs.

---

## Exit Reasoning

**Why manual close at 1.33812 instead of TP at 1.33600?**

The FTMO challenge was PASSED. The goal was achieved. There was no reason to hold on for more risk. We did our job.

This is mature trading - knowing when to take profit.
