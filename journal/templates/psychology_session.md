## Trading Triggers (Know Your Demons)
### FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
**Signs you're in FOMO:**
- "I need to get in NOW"
- "It's running without me"
- "I'll chase this move"
- Entering without setup confirmation
**Solution:** 
> "The market will ALWAYS give another opportunity. Missing this trade doesnt hurt me. Losing money does."
---
### Revenge Trading
**Signs you're revenge trading:**
- Just got stopped
- Immediately re-entering same direction
- "I'll make it back on this one"
- Size up to recover faster
- No new confirmation, same thesis
**Solution:**
> "Two strikes = walk away. I can trade this setup TOMORROW in the next session. My capital is more important than proving Im right."
---
### Ego Trading
**Signs ego is in control:**
- "I KNOW Im right about this"
- Holding a loser hoping it comes back
- Adding to a losing position
- Refusing to take the stop
- Moving stop further away
**Solution:**
> "The market doesnt care what I think. My job is to manage risk, not to be right."

### The Two Strike Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
If you get stopped TWICE on the same:
1. Symbol
2. Thesis
3. Session
YOU MUST:
1. STOP trading that pair
2. Wait for NEXT session
3. Require NEW confirmation
4. No exceptions
Why this exists:
On Jan 15, you were stopped 8 times on GBPUSD. Same thesis. Same session. Lost $234.
If youd followed Two Strike Rule after entries 1 and 2, youd have lost $47.25 instead of $234.
