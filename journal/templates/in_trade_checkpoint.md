- [ ] Re-enter after a stop
- [ ] Move your stop loss

## 🧠 THE 5-SECOND RULE

Count to 5 out loud before ANY action. 

If you can't wait 5 seconds, you're trading on emotion, not logic.

**Say this out loud:**

> "I am about to [ACTION]. My original plan was [PLAN]. I have taken [#] entries today. I am looking at the [TIMEFRAME] chart. My HTF thesis is [STILL VALID / BROKEN]. This will cost me $[AMOUNT]."
