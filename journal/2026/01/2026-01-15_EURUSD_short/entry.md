## Your Analysis
*(Completed first - unbiased by my breakdown)*

### What do you see?
Weekly sell model in play. Tuesday likely printed the high of the week. Currently in a distribution phase - no accumulation expected at these levels. The Dec-Jan rally was a retracement for a larger move lower.

### What's your bias and why?
**BEARISH** - Expecting continuation lower. We're in a sell model, back at a distribution zone. Price should seek sellside liquidity below.

### Where's your entry?
**1.1650** (already in)

### Where's your stop?
**1.1670** - Above yesterday's high. If price takes out the weekly high, thesis is invalidated and expecting continuation higher instead.

### Where's your target(s)?
**-0.5 fib extension (~1.1560 area)** - Below the equal lows. This is a high-probability ICT extension level where price can find disruption after sweeping sellside liquidity.

### What confluences support this trade?
1. Weekly sell model (high of week likely in)
2. Equal lows / sellside liquidity below (~1.1625)
3. Distribution zone - no accumulation expected here
4. -0.5 fib extension target
5. Larger HTF bearish structure (rally was retracement)

### What could invalidate this idea?
Price taking out 1.1670 (yesterday's high / would become new weekly high) - would suggest bullish continuation instead of distribution.

### Additional Context (Follow-up)
- **On the Jan 11 displacement**: It hit the order block and we're not seeing positive reaction. Already back in accumulation zone = distribution coming. The move was a retracement within a larger sell model, not a true reversal.
- **Time**: High/low of week typically Tuesday/Wednesday. Tuesday's high + full retracement suggests algorithm balancing weekly range for order flow.
- **Equal lows**: Expecting a heavier move down to that liquidity. Will watch reaction there but primary target is that level.
- **Trade management**: Needs guidance on partial profits and trailing stop strategy.

## Copilot ICT Breakdown
*(Completed after your analysis)*

### Market Structure
- **Macro**: Bearish from early Dec highs (~1.18+) down to Jan 11 low
- **Jan 11 candle**: Strong bullish displacement - but price has not followed through. Tapped OB and stalled.
- **Current**: Lower high forming after failure to hold above 1.17. Classic distribution signature.

### ICT Concepts Present
| Concept | Present? | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Sell model | ✅ | Weekly high likely in (Tuesday) |
| Equal lows (SSL) | ✅ | Clear at ~1.1625 - untapped liquidity |
| Failed OB retest | ✅ | Bullish OB was hit, no continuation |
| Premium zone | ✅ | Currently in premium of recent range |
| FVG below | ⚠️ | Possible unfilled gap in 1.1550-1.1600 area |

### Copilot's Read
Agree with thesis. The Jan 11 move looks like weekly range expansion / manipulation rather than a true reversal:
1. Price retraced nearly the full move
2. No bullish follow-through after OB tap
3. Equal lows sitting as draw on liquidity

**Watch**: The 1.1625 equal lows could act as magnet AND reversal zone. If price wicks there and closes back above 1.1650 on 4H = warning sign. If slices through cleanly = -0.5 target in play.

### Trade Management Plan
**Stop Loss Trail**:
- Now: Hold at 1.1670
- After 1.1625 breaks: Move to 1.1660 (BE + buffer)
- At 1.1600: Move to 1.1640 (lock ~1R)
- At 1.1575: Move to 1.1610 (lock ~2R)

**Partials**:
- 1.1625 (equal lows): Take 25% off
- 1.1600: Take 25% off
- 1.1560 (-0.5 ext): Close remaining 50%

### Copilot Confidence
**MEDIUM-HIGH** - Thesis is sound. Only flip to bullish if price reclaims 1.1700 with conviction.

## Discussion
*(Back-and-forth until we reach alignment)*

**Copilot**: Raised concern about Jan 11 displacement being a potential ChoCH/reversal.

**Ashton**: Explained it was a retracement within larger sell model - OB was hit with no follow-through, back in distribution zone. Algorithm balancing weekly range.

**Copilot**: Asked about equal lows - expecting slice-through or wick reversal?

**Ashton**: Expecting heavier move down to liquidity. Will watch reaction at that level but primary target is there. Not worried about reversal - one target in mind.

**Copilot**: Asked about trade management (partials/trailing).

**Ashton**: Needs guidance. Wants lion's chunk of move but open to structured approach.

**Copilot**: Provided trailing stop plan (move after structure breaks) and partial profit strategy (25% at lows, 25% at 1.16, 50% at -0.5 extension).

**Ashton**: Waiting for London tonight or NY tomorrow for confirmation of direction. If price heats up to buy side during session = likely wrong. Not seeing support for upside currently.

**Alignment**: ✅ Both agree on bearish thesis, sell model, and equal lows as target. Management plan established.

| Entry Price | 1.1650 |
| Stop Loss | 1.1670 (20 pips) |
| Target 1 | 1.1625 (equal lows - 25 pips) |
| Target 2 | 1.1560 (-0.5 fib ext - 90 pips) |
| Position Size | ~1.25 standard lots (125,000 units) |
| Risk (% / $) | 2.5% / $250 |
| R:R Ratio | 4.5:1 (to T2) |
| Direction | SHORT |
| Model | Weekly Sell Model (Distribution) |
| Confluences | 1) Weekly high likely in (Tue), 2) Equal lows/SSL below on EU, 3) Failed OB retest, 4) Premium zone, 5) -0.5 fib extension target, **6) DXY equal highs / buyside liquidity (inverse correlation)** |
| Confidence | **HIGH** |
| Killzone/Session | Watching London (tonight) / NY (tomorrow AM) for confirmation |
| HTF Bias | BEARISH |

### DXY Correlation
![DXY Chart](dxy_chart.png)
- Equal highs on DXY at ~98.90-99.00 = buyside liquidity
- If DXY runs higher to grab that liquidity → EUR/USD drops (inverse)
- Adds confluence to EUR/USD short thesis

---

## Pre-Trade Checklist
- [x] HTF bias confirmed
- [ ] In a valid killzone/session *(watching London/NY for confirmation)*
- [x] Minimum 2:1 R:R
- [x] At least 3 confluences *(now 6 confluences)*
- [x] Not revenge trading
- [x] Sized correctly for risk *(2.5% = $250 on $10k account)*
- [x] Clear invalidation level

---

## Decision
**TAKE** ✅

Reasoning: Weekly sell model in play. Tuesday high likely in. Failed OB retest with no bullish follow-through. Equal lows as clear draw on liquidity. 4.5R potential with defined invalidation at 1.1670. Already in position - managing with trailing stop plan.

---

## Emotional Check-In (Pre-Trade)
Calm. Thesis is clear. Waiting for session confirmation but not anxious about outcome. Stop is defined.

---

## Session Watch Notes
- **London (Jan 15 ~3AM EST)**: If price starts pushing higher with conviction → early warning
- **NY AM (Jan 15 ~8AM EST)**: Key confirmation session. Bearish displacement here = add to conviction. Bullish push toward 1.1680+ = tighten or exit

## 📝 Live Trade Notes (In-The-Moment)

### Update #1 - Jan 15, 2026 ~01:47 AM
**Current Price:** 1.16302

**What I'm Seeing:**
- Price has dropped from 1.17 high down to 1.163 area
- That's roughly **70 pips** of displacement since the high
- CLEAR sell-side delivery - no real buying pressure
- Currently sitting at 1.16302 - approaching our first target area (equal lows at 1.1625)

**Chart Observations (15M):**
- Heavy displacement candles visible from the Jan 11 high
- Lower highs, lower lows structure intact
- Price action is EFFICIENT - not choppy, clean selling
- Each retracement is being sold into

**Trade Health:**
| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Thesis | ✅ CONFIRMED - displacement validates sell model |
| Current P/L | ~+200 pips from 1.1650 entry (unrealized) |
| Stop Status | Still at 1.1670 - 37 pips above current price |
| Target 1 | 1.1625 - ~5 pips away! |
| Target 2 | 1.1560 - ~70 pips away |

**Mindset:**
- Staying patient - thesis is playing out exactly as planned
- NOT moving stop yet - want to see structure break below 1.1625
- GU correlation confirmed - both pairs selling together

**What's Next:**
- Watching 1.1625 level (equal lows) - key reaction point
- If price slices through with displacement → HUGE confirmation for T2
- If price finds support → take partials, reassess
