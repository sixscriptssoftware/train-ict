## ✅ QUICK CHECKLIST (Must-Haves)

Before ANY trade, confirm:
- [ ] HTF bias is clear (not guessing)
- [ ] I can name the ICT model
- [ ] I'm in or near a killzone
- [ ] Stop loss is at a level that makes sense (not arbitrary)
- [ ] Target is based on liquidity (not just "hope")
- [ ] Risk is sized correctly for account
- [ ] I'm not revenge trading
