# Forward Test: GBPUSD Weekly Outlook

## Current Context
- Price has swept recent highs at ~1.3480-90.
- AI (VEX) predicted immediate bearish reversal using BSL Sweep logic.
- Human (Villain) predicts one final "Leg Up" to clear BSL further left before the true drop.

## The Hypothesis (Villain's Call)
1.  **Immediate Move:** Another leg UP (Stop Hunt 2.0).
2.  **Target:** Cleaner BSL to the left (above 1.3500?).
3.  **Weekly Profile:** This final rally establishes the **High of the Week**.
4.  **Subsequent Move:** Reversal and sell-off for the remainder of the week.
5.  **Final Target:** Sellside Liquidity (SSL) at **1.3380**.

## Verification Plan
- Check chart EOD Tuesday and mid-week Wednesday.
- If price breaks 1.3500+ then drops -> Villain Correct (Complex Inducement).
- If price drops immediately -> VEX Correct (Simple Sweep).

## Learning Goal
Determine if VEX is "trigger happy" on the first sweep, while the human trader correctly anticipates the "Second Mouse Gets the Cheese" dynamic (deeper liquidity runs).
